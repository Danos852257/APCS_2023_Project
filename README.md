# APCS_2023_Project

This repository contains a two player game in game.py which uses python and pygame to run.
In the game, the two ghosts, controlled by each player, fight each other until one runs out of health.
The game is not completely done, so some segments of code don't do anything and some game functions that don't work as intended.

The controls are as follows:
Red Player:
- Move Left: A
- Move Right: D
- Jump: W
- Draw Sword: X
- Attack: C

Blue Player:
- Move and Jump using arrow keys
- Draw Sword: J
- Attack: K
